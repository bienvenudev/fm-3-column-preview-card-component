## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

- I learned how to use more than one class on a single element to optimize the css code and make changes easily.
- For the second time I used paint to measure the spacings and get as close to the design as possible.

### Continued development

I want to keep using BEM to make my code clean and readable
